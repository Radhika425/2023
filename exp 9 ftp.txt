ftp_server = "10.0.2.15" #You can put your systemâ€™s IP address here (find using ifconfig)

ftp_username = "ladkaonubuntu" #You can put default user ID and pass of the system

ftp_password = "LocalLadka@hubuntu"

 

# Connect to the FTP server

ftp = FTP(ftp_server)

ftp.login(ftp_username, ftp_password)

 

# List directory contents

print("Directory listing:")

ftp.retrlines('LIST')

 

# Upload a file to the server

local_file = "file_to_upload.txt"

remote_file = "uploaded_file.txt"

with open(local_file, 'rb') as file:

          ftp.storbinary(f'STOR {remote_file}', file)

 

# Download a file from the server

downloaded_file = "downloaded_file.txt"

with open(downloaded_file, 'wb') as file:

          ftp.retrbinary(f'RETR {remote_file}', file.write)

 

# Close the FTP connection

ftp.quit()

 

print(f"{remote_file} uploaded and {downloaded_file} downloaded.")
