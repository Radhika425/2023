       " 'i tried this drug twice and bad experiences both times i was prescribed it to try and relieve severe thoracic spinal pain believed to have developed from fibromyalgia as the level of pain i am experiencing cannot be explained by any other way in a short time of taking the drug the first time i was told to take the full dose right away of 150 mg i felt shaky nauseated and my toes blistered up around 3 of the toenails on each foot had rashes develop on my hands and arms and did not realize until i was at the optometrist that my vision had worsened quickly i immediately went off if it then a year later was asked to try it again with this time slowly working up to the 150 mg dose this helped a lot because i didnt get the nausea or shakiness but like the first time i got the toe blistering and now around the nails on my fingers as well i felt my vision which had improved once i was off the drug was now getting blurrier again and my brain seemed to be less coherent than when not on the drug overall im glad i dont take it anymore but feel ive lost vision that i dont believe i can get back',\n",
       " '450mg daily taken for nerve damage pain associated with neurofibromatosis t1  side effects include anxiety if a dose is missed  other side effects include increased apatite and increased energy  also to note lyrica works well for general anxiety and i have been able to stop all other medications for anxiety ',\n",

       " 'i have used the most you can take with fibromyalgia 450 mg and i gained about 5 pounds plus i had taken this drug for over 7 years i went off of lyrica and started taking gabapentin up to 1800 mg and about 15 pounds heavier i am now with my doctors help weaning off of gabapentin which didnt help all of my nerve pain and going back on lyrica i think it really depends on your makeup as far as whether you should take lyrica or gabapentin some people have nothing but great experiences with lyrica  and some have great experiences with gabapentin and some have just the opposite it really depends on the person',\n",
